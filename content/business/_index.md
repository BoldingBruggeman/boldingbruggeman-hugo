From the very beginning the code we have written has been made available to the 
public as Free Software. We have been using the GPL license for all our 
software. Over the last years it has been increasingly difficult to obtain 
sufficient funding to carry out our contribution the further development of the 
various software projects we are involved in – most notable 
[GETM](http://www.getm.eu)
 and 
[GOTM](http://www.gotm.net)
. As 
a consequence we will try out a ‘crowd funding’ approach where we will try 
to obtain the funding of our contributions through financial contribution from 
the users of the software. The idea is that we develop a new feature (either on 
our own initiative or through the request from others) and – when – in a 
state where it is ready for beta-release we announce the software on this site 
together with an amount to cover our development expenses. In case sufficient 
funds can be raised the new feature will be released to the public via the 
public git repository.

## Projects by the hour

We focus on the development and application of 
[FABM](http://www.fabm.net/wiki), 
[GOTM](http://www.gotm.net)
 and 
[GETM](http://www.getm.eu)
. For 
instance, we can develop new functionality for these software packages: in 
consultation with the client, we define a project that will implement, test and 
deliver a high quality component. Typically, the result of these developments 
will be included in the public repository with a proper acknowledgement. In 
cases where we have full copyright of the software – typically everything but 
[GOTM](http://www.gotm.net)
 and 
[GETM](http://www.getm.eu)
 – custom tailored licensing agreements can be arranged. This 
might be appropriate in cases where proprietary data are included.

Using Amazon Elastic Cloud/Amazon Web Services we can assist in the following 
project types:

Configuring a 
[GOTM](http://www.gotm.net)
 auto-calibration job on a massive parallel computer using 
[ACPy](/portfolio/acpy/)
. The search for an optimal parameter set to be used for a 
[GOTM](http://www.gotm.net)
 setup is a 
very computer intensive task. Using Amazon services we can assist in 
configuring the job to do the task.

We can also create simulation setups from the ground – i.e. prepare all 
necessary input files, create necessary configuration files and perform basic 
test simulations. We might even implement the setups on Amazon Elastic 
Cloud/Amazon Web Services. This will allow you to run massive parallel very 
compute intensive fully 3D simulations without to have to invest in dedicated 
hardware.

If any of the above is interesting please contact us if you for further 
discussion.
