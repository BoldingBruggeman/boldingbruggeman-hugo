PyNcView is a stand-alone application for viewing 
[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) 
files on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. It is written in [Python](www.python.org)
 and builds upon [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) and 
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/).

<!--more-->

PyNcView can visualize arbitrary [CF](www.cfconventions.org) compliant NetCDF 
files. It is also aware of the coordinate systems of 
[GOTM](www.gotm.net)
 and 
[GETM](www.getm.eu)
, and provides additional 
functionality for files created by these models.
