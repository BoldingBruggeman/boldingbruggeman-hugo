The General Estuarine Transport Model [GETM](www.getm.eu) is a primitive
equation numerical model for ocean and lake simulations.

<!--more-->

GETM was initiated by Hans Burchard and Karsten Bolding in 1999. GETM is a 
3D primitive equation numerical ocean model using the turbulence library 
from GOTM. BB has – as with GOTM – always been responsible for maintaining i
the code – first using CVS and later using git. BB has provided numerous code i
contributions and has participated very active on the developers and users i
mailing lists.
