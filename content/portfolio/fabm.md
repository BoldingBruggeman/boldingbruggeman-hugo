The Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) provides a generic, easy to use, high performance coupling layer that connects a hydrodynamic model (e.g., 1D water column, 3D world ocean) with multiple biogeochemical submodels.

Development of FABM was initiated in the EU FP7 project [MEECE](http://www.meece.eu). Since then, BB has continued to maintain and further develop FABM, with all changes made publicly available under the GPL.
