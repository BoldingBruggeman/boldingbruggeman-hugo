EditScenario is a 
[python](http://www.python.org) 
script used to generate and manipulate Fortran namelists - based on XML formatted configuration file.

<!--more-->

EditScenario.py can be operated in both a scriptable and GUI based way.

EditScenario requires a schema definition for the Fortran namelists to 
generate as well as a file with actual settings for a specific configuration. 
The use of XML as configuration language allows for a much richer experince 
compared to Fortran namelists including – in addition to variable values – 
human readable descriptions and variable units.
